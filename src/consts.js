  'Ammonia': {
    title: 'Ammonia',
    description: `Vapors may irritate the skin, eyes, throat, and lungs. 
    Ammonia may also cause kidney and liver damage. 
    If ammonia is mixed with products containing chlorine bleach (sodium hypochlorite),
     highly poisonous chloramine gas is formed.`

  '2-Butoxyethanol': {
    title: '2-Butoxyethanol',
    description: `A skin and eye irritant also associated with blood disorders. 
    In laboratory experiments, exposure to high doses of 2-BE has been shown 
    to cause reproductive problems.`
  },
  'monoethanalomine': {
    title: 'monoethanalomine',
    description: `Hormone-disrupting chemicals that can form cancer-causing nitrates. 
    A skin, eye and respiratory irritant.`
  },
  'Nonylphenol ethoxylate': {
    title: 'Nonylphenol ethoxylate',
    description: `Degrade into nonylphenols (NPs), which can mimic the hormone estrogen. 
    In laboratory experiments, NP has been shown to stimulate the growth of human breast 
    cancer cells and cause adverse reproductive effects in fish and other aquatic organisms.`

  'Phosphate': {
    title: 'Phosphate',
    description: `Environmental hazard causing excessive growth in aquatic plants which 
    leads to the suffocation of fish & underwater life.`
  },
  'Quaternary Ammonium Compound': {
    title: 'Quaternary Ammonium Compound',
    description: `Irritant and sensitizer that can induce an allergic response following 
    contact with the skin. Quats are also known to cause occupational asthma in cleaning 
    workers and preliminary evidence indicates they may cause adverse genetic and 
    reproductive effects.`

  'Sodium dichloroisocyanurate dehydrate': {
    title: 'Sodium dichloroisocyanurate dehydrate',
    description: `Corrosive, severe eye, skin and respiratory irritant. It can also form 
    chlorine gas, which will burn the eyes, nose and mouth. Studies have found that high 
    doses of this chemical cause kidney damage.`
  },
  'Sodium hydroxide': {
    title: 'Sodium hydroxide',
    description: `Highly corrosive; can burn the eyes, skin and lungs and is a respiratory
     irritant. Long-term exposure in the air may lead to ulceration of the nasal passages 
     and chronic skin irritation.`

    not develop properly if expose to SLS or SLES and may damage the skin’s immune system.`
  },
  'Triclosan': {
    title: 'Triclosan',
    description: `Synthetic antibacterial that is toxic and a suspected endocrine 
    disrupter that can mimic or interfere with the function of hormones. There is 
    concern that its extensive use in consumer products is contributing to 
    antibiotic-resistant bacteria.`
  },
  'Phenol': {
    title: 'Phenol',
    description: `Extremely caustic chemical that burns the skin. 
    Absorption through the lungs or skin can cause central nervous system damage, 
    pneumonia, respiratory problems, kidney and liver damage, numbness, vomiting 
    and a be fatal.`
